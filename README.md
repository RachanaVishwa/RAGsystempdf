# Chat with PDF - RAG system - ü§ñ Gemini AI ‚ú®

RAG system on "Leave no Context Behind" research paper

Objective - 

As we know that LLMs like Gemini lack the company specific information. But this latest information is available via PDFs, Text Files, etc... Now if we can connect our LLM with these sources, we can build a much better application.


Using LangChain framework, build a RAG system that can utilize the power of LLM like Gemini 1.5 Pro to answer questions on the ‚ÄúLeave No Context Behind‚Äù paper published by Google on 10th April 2024. In this process, external data(i.e. Leave No Context Behind Paper) should be retrieved and then passed to the LLM when doing the generation step.

# Question - what are compressive memory systems? how are they more scalable and efficient than the attention mechanism for extremely long sequences?
